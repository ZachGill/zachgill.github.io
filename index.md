## Zachary Gillenwater's Brilliant Github Page

Neato burrito, it's a website and on GitHub and stuff

### What I Do

Code, mostly. Check out my GitHub profile to see some of my small personal projects, like a web API written in Go that answers math questions posed in query parameters.

### What is the purpose of this page?

* Because I've been instructed to do so for a Computer Science course
  * And if I don't
    * I will get a zero
    
### I will probably put useful information on this page at some point
More likely I'll forget it exists for a while, see that it's barren, and then get rid of it until I have useful information to place on it
